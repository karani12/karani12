# Hi there, I'm Karani ðŸ‘‹
I am a software engineer with 4 years experience building and deploying web applications. **I am currently open to work**.

#### skills
- PHP & Laravel(TALL + filamentphp)
- React + Nodejs(NestJs) + React Native
- Golang
- Apache2 & Nginx configuration
- Server admin
- SQL + Mysql + Sqlite
- Docker, EC2 and RDS

Throughout my career I have also worked with other technologies like `kotlin` and `springboot`, `flask` and `python`. I can pick those up easily and only listed what I have used mostly for the past one year. I also love the operating system stuff that I play around using the `C language`. Mostly I love the concepts around memory management and concurrency. Soon looking at virtualization and more of the file system. This are things I just love because, `who wouldn't want to learn how scheduling works in os?` or `how to pass user threads to kernel threads.`

Also I prefer the linux api because its snake case. Also windows api seems to just confuse me lol.

I have worked on several projects too:
- opencui runtime ~ Runtime to support AI chatbots to communicate with people and also link with NLP models.
- Restaurant manager ~ Restaurant management SAAS
- Referral marketing tool ~ A marketing app(IOS and Android) and backend to support the system.
- etc

If you have a project that you would love me to be a part of, just reach me through my email karanijohn018[at]gmail[dot]com
